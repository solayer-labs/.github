## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Solayer is building the restaking network on Solana: a shared validator network that extends the security of Solana and safeguards other decentralized networks. This reduces the required capital for securing emerging networks. Solayer facilitates  a marketplace for AVS modules so validators and stakers can manage their restaking easily.

Our main organizations are research and development, working towards extending the shared security infrastructure from Solana and beyond.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Solayer is building the restaking network on Solana: a shared validator network that extends the security of Solana and safeguards other decentralized networks. This reduces the required capital for securing emerging networks. Solayer facilitates  a marketplace for AVS modules so validators and stakers can manage their restaking easily.

We have research and development organizations, working towards extending the shared security infrastructure from Solana and beyond.
